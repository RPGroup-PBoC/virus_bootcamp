The goal of these lectures was to get the very bright but inexperienced young researchers up to speed on the key elements of nuclear physics they would need to build the atomic bomb.

   description: This retrospective by Fraenkel-Conrat and Singer reflects on the
beautiful and, quite frankly, amazing experiments they did to reconstitute
the tobacco mosaic virus from purified components.  They found that
when they mixed viral RNA and the TMV proteins, they got back
rod-shaped visions that were indistinguishable from the wild-type virus
and that were similarly infectious.
