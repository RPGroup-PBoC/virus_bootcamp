   title: The Los Alamos primer -- The first lectures on how to build an atomic bomb.
   authors: Robert Serber.
#   journal: 
#   volume: 
#   issue: 
   year: 1992
   link: Los_Alamos_Primer.pdf
   description: This famous set of lectures was delivered at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project by Prof. Robert Serber. The goal of these lectures was to get the very bright but inexperienced young researchers up to speed on the key elements of nuclear physics they would need to build the atomic bomb.

   title: Virus reconstitution and the proof of the existence of genomic RNA.
   authors: H Fraenkel-Conrat and B Singer.
#   journal: 
#   volume: 
#   issue: 
   year: 1999
   link: FraenkelConratReconstitution.pdf
   description: This retrospective by Fraenkel-Conrat and Singer reflects on the beautiful and, quite frankly, amazing experiments they did to reconstitute the tobacco mosaic virus from purified components.  They found that when they mixed viral RNA and the TMV proteins, they got back rod-shaped visions that were indistinguishable from the wild-type virus and that were similarly infectious.

   title:  Chaos in the Brickyard
   authors: Bernard K. Forscher.
#   journal: 
#   volume: 
#   issue: 
   year: 1963
   link: 339.1.full.pdf
   description: From Ollie Stephenson. To follow up on the Poincare quote, this is a nice (and short) letter from 1963 science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1. It likens the production of scientific facts to making bricks, and scientific explanations/laws as edifices made from these bricks. The author is saying that scientists have lost sight of the fact that they’re supposed to be building edifices and instead are just making more and more bricks, leading to chaos in the brickyard.
